# My Awesome Website

Welcome to my website! This project was built using cutting-edge web technologies by me, a fullstack JavaScript and Python developer. I specialize in creating dynamic, scalable, and efficient web applications. Feel free to explore the code and see how everything works under the hood.

# Project Structure
All the custom CSS can be found in the index.css file.
This project is built using TailwindCSS for styling, making it easy to maintain and scale the design.
